            <h2>Seasons of India</h2>
            <p>
                India experiences four distinct seasons: summer, monsoon, autumn, and winter. Summer spans from March to June, characterized by scorching temperatures, especially in the northern plains. Monsoon arrives in June and lasts till September, bringing relief from the heat with heavy rainfall, crucial for agriculture. Autumn, from October to November, marks the transition period with clear skies and comfortable temperatures. Finally, winter, from December to February, brings cooler weather, especially in the northern regions, with some areas experiencing frost and even snowfall. Each season holds significance in Indian culture and plays a vital role in shaping the country's agricultural and social rhythms.

            <h2>Summers in India</h2>
            <p>
                During the summer season in India, which typically spans from March to June, the country experiences scorching temperatures, particularly in the northern plains. The mercury often soars to high levels, leading to uncomfortable conditions for outdoor activities. People seek refuge indoors or in shaded areas to escape the heat. However, the southern coastal regions tend to be relatively cooler due to the influence of sea breezes. Summer is also associated with vacations, mangoes, and various cultural festivals across the country. Despite the intensity of the heat, summer is a time when communities come together to celebrate and enjoy the season's offerings.

            <h2>Winters in India</h2>
            <p>
                Winter in India typically spans from December to February, heralding cooler temperatures across the country. While southern regions enjoy milder weather, northern India experiences chilly days and cold nights, with some areas even witnessing frost and occasional snowfall in the higher altitudes. The winter season offers a respite from the scorching heat of summer and the heavy rains of the monsoon, making it an ideal time for outdoor activities and festivals. It's also a crucial period for agriculture, as crops like wheat and mustard thrive in the cooler climate. Additionally, winter brings a festive spirit, with celebrations like Diwali and Christmas adding warmth and joy to the cold days.

            <h2>Monsoon in India</h2>
            <p>
                The monsoon season in India typically spans from June to September, heralding relief from the scorching summer heat. Characterized by heavy rainfall, it is a crucial period for agriculture, replenishing reservoirs and watering crops. However, the monsoon also brings challenges such as flooding, landslides, and waterborne diseases, particularly in low-lying areas and regions with inadequate infrastructure. Despite these challenges, the monsoon holds cultural significance, with festivals like Teej and Raksha Bandhan celebrated during this time. Overall, the monsoon season plays a pivotal role in shaping India's economy, environment, and social life.

                Autumn in India, spanning from October to November, is a transitional phase marked by pleasant weather and clear skies after the monsoon season. Temperatures begin to moderate, offering relief from the summer heat. The landscape takes on a golden hue as trees shed their leaves, and fields are ready for harvest, making it a crucial time for farmers. Festivals like Diwali, Durga Puja, and Navratri add vibrant colors and cultural fervor to the season, celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. Autumn holds a special place in Indian hearts, symbolizing a time of reflection, gratitude, and anticipation for the upcoming winter season.
